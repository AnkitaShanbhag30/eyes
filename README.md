# eyes
Nothing much to see here. Just a couple of eyes following you around, you know, like eyes do.

## How to Run

1. Download the repository or clone it to your local machine
2. Open [index.html](./index.html)
3. Move the mouse pointer around the screen, and observe that the eyes always follow the pointer

## Roadmap of future improvements

- Overlay the eyes on a face to improve the user experience
- Make the eyes blink or wink every time the mouse is clicked
- Make the eyes close when the mouse pointer hovers over them
- Randomize the eye color and style upon each page load
- Improving the user interface
